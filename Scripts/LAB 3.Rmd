This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

# Part A: Foundations
## Briefly name and describe the three fundamental components of a function.

 * 1. The formals(), the list of arguments that control how you call the function.
 * 2. The body(), the code inside the function.
 * 3. The environment(), the data structure that determines how the function finds the values associate with the names.

## Describe three different ways functions can be stored/applied and an example of when you might want to use each version.

# 1. Create a function object (with function) and bind it to a name with <-
```{r}
f01 <- function(x) {
  sin(1 / x ^ 2)
}
```
# 2. Anonymous function.

```{r}
lapply(mtcars, function(x) length(unique(x)))
Filter(function(x) !is.numeric(x), mtcars)
integrate(function(x) sin(x) ^ 2, 0, pi)

```

# 3. Put functions in a vector (list):

```{r}
funs <- list(
  quarter = function(x) x / 4,
  half = function(x) x / 2,
  double = function(x) x * 2,
  quadruple = function(x) x * 4
)
```

# Part B Applied Practice
## 1. Write a function to calculate the mean that removes missing data before conducting the calculation. You may not use base::mean or any similar function that conducts a mean calculation. Include a warning in your function if missing data have been removed that prints the total number of cases that were removed.


```{r}
mean1 <- function(x) {
  if (sum(is.na (x) >0 )){
    x_lngths <-paste0("Number of missing case : ", sum(is.na (x)))
    warning("WARNING: Missing data have been removed, ", x_lngths)
  na <- na.omit(x)
  return(
    sum(x/length(na), na.rm = T))}
else{(sum(x/length(x)))}
}
```

# 2. Test your function to make sure it (a) provides the expected results, and (b) gives identical output to base::mean when na.rm = TRUE. Make sure that you test your data against a vector that has missing data.

```{r}
a <- c(1, NA, NA, 3, 3, 9, NA)
b <- c(NA, 3, NA, 4, NA, NA, NA)
c <- c(6,2,4,5)

mean(a, na.rm = T)
mean1(a)
mean(b, na.rm = T)
mean1(b)
mean(c, na.rm = T)
mean1(c)
```
## 3. Turn the following three lines of code into three different functions. Make sure to give them meaningful names. Test the functions to make sure they provide the expected output.
```{r}
# Count number of missing elements in a vector
Vector_NA <- function (x) {
  sum(is.na(x))}
Vector_NA(airquality$Ozone)

# Proportional representation of each level (unique element) in a vector
unique_element <- function(x){
  purrr::map_dbl(split(x, x), length) / length(x)
}
unique_element(mtcars$cyl)

# normalize or z-score a vector so the mean is zero and sd is one
ZScore <- function(x) {
  (x - mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)) / 
  sd(x, na.rm = TRUE)
}

ZScore(mtcars$mpg)
```

# 4. Write a function that takes a data frame as its input and returns a data frame with only the numeric columns.

```{r}
Numeric_df <- function (x){
nums <- unlist(lapply(x, is.numeric))  
return(x[, nums])}

# Example
d <- data.frame(x1 = 1:5,                         # Create example data frame
                   x2 = LETTERS[1:5],
                   x3 = 2,
                   x4 = factor(c(1, 3, 2, 2, 1)),
                   stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

Numeric_df(d)
```

# 5. Write a function that uses the function you wrote in Question 5, and returns a data frame with the mean and standard deviation of each numeric column. 

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)

summarize_cols <- function(data, ...) {
    Numeric_df(data) %>% 
        pivot_longer(everything(), 
                     names_to = "var", 
                     values_to = "val") %>%
        group_by(var) %>%
        summarize(mean = mean(val, na.rm = TRUE),
                  sd = sd(val, na.rm = TRUE))
}

summarize_cols(d)
```

# If columns are omitted (because they are non-numeric), print a message stating the specific columns that were not included.

```{r}
summarize_cols_1 <- 
  function(x){
    all_numeric <- 
      unlist(lapply(x, is.numeric))
  
    if (sum(all_numeric == FALSE) > 0){
      message(sum(all_numeric == FALSE), 
              ' non-numeric row(s) removed: ', 
              names(x[, !all_numeric])
              )
      return(Numeric_df(x))
  } else {
    Numeric_df(x)
    }
  }
```
# Example 
```{r}
summarize_cols_1(d)

```
