# Part A: Foundations
## Briefly name and describe the three fundamental components of a function.

 * 1. The formals(), the list of arguments that control how you call the function.
 * 2. The body(), the code inside the function.
 * 3. The environment(), the data structure that determines how the function finds the values associate with the names.

## Describe three different ways functions can be stored/applied and an example of when you might want to use each version.

# 1. Create a function object (with function) and bind it to a name with <-
```{r}
f01 <- function(x) {
  sin(1 / x ^ 2)
}
```
# 2. Anonymous function.

```{r}
lapply(mtcars, function(x) length(unique(x)))
Filter(function(x) !is.numeric(x), mtcars)
integrate(function(x) sin(x) ^ 2, 0, pi)

```

# 3. Put functions in a vector (list):

```{r}
funs <- list(
  quarter = function(x) x / 4,
  half = function(x) x / 2,
  double = function(x) x * 2,
  quadruple = function(x) x * 4
)
```

# Part B Applied Practice
## Write a function to calculate the mean that removes missing data before conducting the calculation. You may not use base::mean or any similar function that conducts a mean calculation. Include a warning in your function if missing data have been removed that prints the total number of cases that were removed.

```{r}
mean1 <- function(x) {
  if (is.na(x)){
    stop("missing data")
  }
  (sum(x/length(x)))
}
```


```{r}
mean1 <- function(x) {
  if (sum(is.na (x) >0 )){
    x_lngths <-paste0("Number of missing case : ", sum(is.na (x)))
    warning("WARNING: Missing data have been removed, ", x_lngths)
  na <- na.omit(x)
  return(sum(x/length(na), na.rm = T))}
else{(sum(x/length(x)))}
}
```
```{r}
d <- c(3,2,1,3,4,5,8,NA,NA,NA)

mean(d, na.rm = T)
mean1(d)

```
```{r}
temp <- tibble(
  v1 = 1:20, 
  v2 = 21:40, 
  v3 = c(1:18, NA, NA), 
  v4 = letters[1:20]
  )
mean1(temp$v1)
mean(temp$v1)
mean1(temp$v2)
mean(temp$v2)
mean1(temp$v3)
mean(temp$v3, na.rm = T)
```
```{r}
library(tibble)
a <- tibble (c1 = 1:8, c2 = factor (c("a", "b", "a", "c", "b", "c", "a", "b")))
a[4,1] <- a[6,2] <- NA
a
mean1(a)
mean(a, na.rm = T)
```

?tibble


mean1(mtcars$mpg)
names(mtcars)


if(length(x) != length(y)) {
        lx <- length(x)
        ly <- length(y)
        v_lngths <- paste0("x = ", lx, ", y = ", ly)
        if(lx %% ly == 0 | ly %% lx == 0) {
            warning("Vectors were recycled (", v_lngths, ")")
        }
        else {
            stop("Vectors are of different lengths and are not recyclable:",
                 v_lngths)    
        }
    }
    sum(is.na(x) & is.na(y))
}
```
